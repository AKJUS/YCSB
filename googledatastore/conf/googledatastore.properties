# Sample property file for Google Cloud Datastore DB client

## Mandatory parameters
#
# Your credentials to Google datastore. See README.md for details.
#
# googledatastore.projectId=<string id of your project>
# googledatastore.datasetId=<string id of your dataset>
# googledatastore.privateKeyFile=<full path to your private key file>
# googledatastore.serviceAccountEmail=<Your service account email>

# Google Cloud Datastore's read and update APIs do not support
# reading or updating a select subset of properties for an entity.
# (as of version v1beta3)
# Therefore, it's recommended that you set writeallfields and readallfields
# to true to get stable and comparable performance numbers.
writeallfields = true
readallfields = true

## Optional parameters
#
# Decides the consistency level of read requests. Acceptable values are:
# EVENTUAL, STRONG (default is STRONG)
#
# googledatastore.readConsistency=STRONG

# Decides how we group entities into entity groups.
# (See the details section in README.md for documentation)
#
# googledatastore.entityGroupingMode=ONE_ENTITY_PER_GROUP

# If you set the googledatastore.entityGroupingMode property to
# MULTI_ENTITY_PER_GROUP, you can optionally specify the name of the root entity
#
# googledatastore.rootEntityName="YCSB_ROOT_ENTITY"

# Strongly recommended to set to uniform.
# requestdistribution = uniform

# Enable/disable debug message, default is false.
# googledatastore.debug = false

# Skip indexes, default is true.
# googledatastore.skipIndex = true

# Enable/disable tracing, default is false.
# To enable publishing traces to Cloud Trace, googledatastore, tracingenabled must be set
# Tracing depends on the following external APIs/Services:
# 1. Java OpenTelemetry SDK
# 2. Cloud Trace Exporter
# 3. TraceServiceClient from Cloud Trace API v1.
# Permissions to enabled tracing (https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/iam#trace-roles):
# 1. gcloud auth application-default login must be run with the test user.
# 2. To write traces, test user must have one of roles/cloudtrace.[admin|agent|user] roles.
# 3. To read traces, test user must have one of roles/cloudtrace.[admin|user] roles.
# googledatastore.tracingenabled = false
